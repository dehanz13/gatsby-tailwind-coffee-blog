Vietnam and coffee have a long relationship. Today Vietnam is the second largest coffee producer in the world, and the first for Robusta coffee. But back before the colonial times, coffee was not well known at all.

The French introduced coffee cultivation and the drinking of it based on their taste: dark, strong and with a heavy body. At the same time, adding milk to it was customary for the French and they kept brewing their cafe au lait in Vietnam too.

But because of the tropical environment, fresh milk would go sour quickly, posing an obstacle to the easy consumption of it along with coffee. Condensed milk was then first imported and then locally produced. This is a type of milk from which most water, roughly 60% of the total, is removed.

Denser than normal milk, it also lasts for months unopened, and for quite a few days after opening. It is ideal for very hot climates as it gives consumers more time to drink it.

From the coffee grown locally and the condensed milk, the Vietnamese coffee was born. This coffee drink is a mix of a dark roasted coffee with the addition of a bit of condensed milk, making it a nice contraposition of strong, bitter coffee and sweet, thick, milk. Vietnamese coffee is a coffee of stark contrast.
